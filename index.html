    <h2>Hello.  I'm Sunny Yuen.  This site is actually a Github repository with my username that I linked to a custom domain name I purchased.  I intend to build out the site to serve as my portfolio.  In the meantime, feel free to browse through a few of my completed assignments from last quarter.  I'd love to hear from you, drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com/eYunnys">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-yuen-a57ab889">linkedin</a>.</h2>
